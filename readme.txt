Add Google Analytics to your website easily and quickly!

== Description ==

Google Analytics by DN allows you to track your website easily.

This plugin uses the Universal Google Analytics tracking code (analytics.js). This adds support for preloading which will provide a small performance boost on modern browsers. However, do note that it can degrade to synchronous loading and execution on IE 9 and older mobile browsers which do not recognize the async attribute.
